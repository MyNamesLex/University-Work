# Advanced Games Development

(This was made using Unity and C#, featuring Unit Tests)

In this unit I was tasked with making a prototype version of the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/"> SNKRX </a> and choose which system to implement. We were given a 'High Concept Document' to read through which explained what we needed to do and explained some of the concepts and mechanics of the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/915310/SNKRX/"> SNKRX </a> and explaining how the game we are making called 'SNEKZ' aims to recapture the success of the game.

The three core mechanics that were explained to us to replicate were:
1. Mob Spawning and Control
2. Local and Networked Multiplayer
3. A Multitude of Abilities

I chose option 3 and this the files in this repo were the outcome.

I believe I did quite well although accomplished in a messy way, all the while utilizing unit tests to help filter out potential hidden bugs.
