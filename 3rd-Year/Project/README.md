# Project

This repository only includes one part of my final year project. This is the product section of the project and does not include the dissertation part.

This product title is 'Using Serious Games To Raise Highway Code Awareness'.

This product went through several highly different design iterations ranging from 2D to 3D. 

I eventually landed on the current design iteration aiming for a 'stylised realism' where you follow the highway code rules and answer correctly to the prompted highway code relating question to progress, which I believe I accomplished with this. I designed the environment using assets found on the asset store listed in the 'Credits.txt' file in the 'Assets' folder. I used Unity's NavMesh to program the pedestrians walking and crossing the road and different methods for different types of AI such as 'TeleportAI', 'BirdTeleportTrigger' AI and 'BikeAi'.

Overall, I am happy to a degree with the outcome of this product as it delivers what is expected and required of it and achieved 80/100 for this product. Still, where I believe this could be improved is with the 'rough around the edges' feel due to the unity timeline animations primarily, but this is a small part of the product in my opinion. I also challenged myself by making car controls which is something I wasn't too comfortable doing and I am proud to a degree with the outcome as I feel it still needs refinement and could be improved
