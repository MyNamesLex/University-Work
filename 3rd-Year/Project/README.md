# Project

This repository only incluides one part of my final year project. This is the product part of it and the dissertation part.

This product title is 'Using Serious Games To Raise Highway Code Awareness'.

This product went through several, highly different design iterations ranging from 2d to 3d. 

I eventually landed on the current design iteration aiming for a 'stylised realism' where you follow the rules of the highway code and answer correctly to the prompted highway code relating question to progress which I believe I accomplished with this.

I wished to have several different levels but me and my supervisor agreed on having just one really good level would suffice. I decided to include these in this repository in the folder titled 'Scrapped Scenes' without making *any* changes to them which is why there is missing textures. I did this so you can see how this product progressed along its course.

Overall, I am happy to an extent with the outcome of this product as it delivers what is expected and required of it but I am unhappy with the 'rough around the edges' feel of it due to the unity timeline animations primarily but this is a small part of the product in my opinion however.
