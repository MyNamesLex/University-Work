# Project

This repository only includes one part of my final year project. This is the product section of the project and does not include the dissertation part.

This product title is 'Using Serious Games To Raise Highway Code Awareness'.

This product went through several highly different design iterations ranging from 2D to 3D. 

I eventually landed on the current design iteration aiming for a 'stylised realism' where you follow the highway code rules and answer correctly to the prompted highway code relating question to progress, which I believe I accomplished with this.

Overall, I am happy to a degree with the outcome of this product as it delivers what is expected and required of it. Still, I am unhappy with the 'rough around the edges' feel due to the unity timeline animations primarily, but this is a small part of the product in my opinion.
