# Game A Week

I have only uploaded the ones that I like the most. If I would have to pick my favourite one out of the bunch here I'd have to go with my Week 6 Game followed relatively closely by my Week 4 Game. 

## Week 1
(This was made with the Unity Game Engine using C#)

A basic find the button maze game.
 
## Week 2
(This was made with Ren'py using the Ren'py language which is similar to Python)

This game is a visual novel where you have to find the killer.

## Week 3
(This was made with the Unity Game Engine using C#)

A 2D Game where when the lights are on the enemies stop moving.

## Week 4
(This was made with the Unity Game Engine using C#)

Had a bit of an experience with my Week 4 game, as you could probably see by the files I wanted to implement online functionality to it but by doing so I bit off a bit more then I could chew with it given the time frame and ended up spending around 4 days on just trying to get this online to work. I ended up contacting my tutor to get help with it and ended up giving up on that because I was spending too much time on just the online part and did not have an actual game. I ended up sticking with the local multiplayer (which I implemented just in case I could not do the online multiplayer, I did get tunnel vision on the online multiplayer looking back on this). With the game overall though it is my 2nd favourite game still because I believe it is honestly a really fun party game.

The whole game a week experience really feels like it has given me a confidence boost with making games in general and making games for a timeframe simultaneously. I really enjoyed this experience too and resulted in me improving my coding abilities, improving my self confidence with building games and kickstarted me into truly having a passion for making games in my off-time alongside making them for University.

## Week 5

(I did not include my Week 5 Game because I don't think it is a good game.)

## Week 6
(This was made with the Unity Game Engine using C#)
